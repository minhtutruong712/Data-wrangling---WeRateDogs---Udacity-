<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the dataset #Weratedogs, there are some insights is
found during the analysis:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. The largest retweet counts and favorite counts in the We
Rate Dog archive, filtered only the rating available are 70k, 143k
respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. The average point of dog rating is 1.22 which is
calculated by rating numerator divided by rating denominator is 1.22 which
means the rating system allows more and more tweets having numerator greater
than denominator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. The prediction rate predict 2073 images, in which the
rate for all True rate is 0.6, at least one True rate is 0.8. In the archive
WeRateDog, the number of predictions of images with rating is more than half of
the total images predicted. The number of images is not dog predicted True is
415 images (account for 20%)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this analysis, our interest is to find the relationship
between the rating point rating numerator/rating denominator) and the number of
retweets or number of favorites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the analysis, due to the rating point data has many
outliers, so that I divide the dataset into 2 parts, (1) excluding outliers,
(2) only outliers for visible visualization and maintain the interpretable
insight and trend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1st column in the chart is used for not oulier data, a
clear positive trend is easily visible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The result displays a slight positive relationship between
rating point and number of retweets or favorites, which means that if the tweet
has the higher rating, the chance it will be retweeted or liked will be higher.</p>
